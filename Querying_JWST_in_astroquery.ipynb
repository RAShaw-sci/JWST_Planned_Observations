    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As with _HST, JWST_ observers are not allowed to propose observations that duplicate existing, planned, or approved observations unless they provide a scientific justification in their proposal and that request is approved. Consult the [JWST Duplicate Observation Policy](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-general-science-policies/jwst-duplicate-observations-policy) for details. Broadly speaking, observations might duplicate if they are obtained with the same scientific instrument (or a different instrument with similar configurations and capabilities), and two or more of the following apply:\n",
    "  * Same astrophysical source, or significant spatial overlap of fields\n",
    "  * Similar imaging passband, or overlapping spectral range\n",
    "  * Similar (spectral) resolution\n",
    "  * Similar exposure depth\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how to use the python package [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html) to search the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) for potential duplicate observations. Proposers may also use the [MAST Portal](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html) to searach the archive, but that may be less efficient for large numbers of targets. "
